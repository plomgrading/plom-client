# Merge request template

(Please give your MR a descriptive title: not just "Fixes #xyz")

(Describe your change.  Make sure you link to any related issues.  For example, include
the phrase `Fixes #xyz`.)


## Changelog entry

(delete all but one choice from this list)

  - I have included a draft below.
  - I have included a Changelog entry within the commit.
  - This change does not need a changelog entry.
  - I'm not sure about this (don't worry, we'll help!)

(Not all merge requests need a Changelog entry: ask yourself if it would be useful for a Plom
Server administrator or a Plom Client user to read a single-sentence summary of this change?
If so, please draft a sentence here; we will copy this into
[the Changelog](https://gitlab.com/plom/plom/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) after mergeing.)
