## Plom's benefits

  * Respects privacy of student data -- all data stays on your server,
    and markers do not see student name or ID when working.
  * Easy multi-versioned tests -- designed to handle crowded classrooms
    and multi-section courses over multiple days.
  * Simplify logistics and minimizes paper-handling.
  * Free -- Plom is both [Libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre#Libre)
    and [Gratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre#Gratis).
    No software to buy, and no subscriptions to pay.
