## Plom's benefits
* Respects privacy of student data -- All data stays on your server, and markers do not see student name or ID when working.

* Easy multi-versioned tests -- Designed to handle crowded classrooms and multi-section courses, when sittings might occur over multiple days.

* Free -- Plom is both [Libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre#Libre) and [Gratis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre#Gratis). There is no software to buy, and no subscriptions to pay.
